Lab Assignments (Individual) There will be six stand-alone lab assignments in this course. In our\\nclasses, we will have Python code examples to demonstrate how to leverage data analytics methods for\\nunstructured data analyses. The lab assignments will provide you opportunity to practice these methods\\non a dataset relevant to your course project.\\n \\n2. Course Project (Team) One of the major goals of this course is to offer hands-on data analytics\\nexperience. The term project is intended to provide such experience by having students process data\\nand perform analyses including text mining, network analysis, machine learning, or other statistical\\ninferences. This course will be using Python for the term project. An overview of the project will be\\nprovided in lecture slides. The project is meant to evolve weekly during the duration of this course. There\\nare three deliverables tied to project milestones: project proposal, exploratory data analyses, and final\\nproject presentation. \\n \\nStudent Responsibilities\\nAttendance \\nEveryone is required to attend classes in person. Zoom attendance is not an option. An online session\\nis not a substitute for an immersion session in most cases. Just like different business meetings, each\\nprogram modality, even hybrid ones, differ in regards to pedagogical approaches dramatically, so\\nunfortunately learning outcomes promised in a program are often not attained the same way across\\ndifferent media. \\n \\nExceptional cases for accommodations apply. ASU has predetermined exceptions that we list below for\\nyour awareness. We specify situations in which students CAN EXPECT vs those they MUST NOT\\nEXPECT accommodations. \\nCAN EXPECT ACCOMMODATIONS:   \\n1. ASU-sanctioned reasons: Jury / military duty, Religious holidays, Health impediments\\n2. Student Accessibility and Inclusive Learning needs (SAILS)\\n3. ONE ONLY event per term per student for any career-related absence (e.g. WPC supported affinity\\nconferences, career fair participation, or job-related travels). \\n \\nMUST NOT EXPECT ACCOMMODATIONS:\\n1/9/25, 11:09 PM Syllabus for CIS 509: Analytics Unstructured Data (2025 Spring DYN)\\nhttps://canvas.asu.edu/courses/211724/assignments/syllabus 6/11'), Document(metadata={'source': './Syllabus.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='1. Personal reasons of various kinds, no matter what nature \\n2. More than one career-related absence per term per student\\n \\nShould you have to miss a class in such cases only, professors can offer “suitable accommodations”,\\nwhich may or may not include Zoom attendance. The accommodations, if available, are to cover one\\nclass only, not more. Should you need exceptions for a longer period of time, please contact your\\nprogram operations staff, and / or your Associate Dean, Luiz.Mesquita@asu.edu\\n(mailto:Luiz.Mesquita@asu.edu) . \\n \\nAssignment Timeliness\\nAt the W. P. Carey School of Business Graduate Programs, “delivering assignments on time” is part of\\nthe assignment. Submitting an assignment late means the student failed the assignment at least in part,\\nand in some cases, entirely. Per ASU, students who turn in assignments on time are to have higher\\ngrades than those who turn in assignments late, and because grades are capped at the top, lateness will\\nnecessarily involve a grade penalty.\\n \\nWe allow late submissions of your assignments up to three days after the deadline. Each day in delay\\nhas a 10% grade penalty toward the total grade of the assignment. \\nCommunicating and Behaving Professionally\\nA hallmark of a W. P. Carey education is that everyone is courteous and professional when\\ncommunicating with each other. Soft skills listed in the code of professionalism represent that standard.\\nAll interactions with your peers, staff, and faculty are to follow that standard. It is ok to disagree with\\neach other on the basis of ideas, but it is not ok to be disagreeable. \\n \\nThe Graduate Programs Office takes the Professionalism Code very seriously because our mission is to\\nensure professionals who graduate from our programs continue to build up on our reputable brand,\\nwhich stands for “Business is Personal”. Please make yourself familiar with the Code, as those falling\\nshort of such standards are subject to disciplinary effects.\\n \\nW. P. Carey School of Business Honor Code\\nUnethical behavior by corporations has been linked with negative performance outcomes; the same is\\ntrue of unethical student behavior. It is expected that students will neither participate in nor condone\\nactivities such as cheating or plagiarism. You are expected to do your own work on all individual\\n1/9/25, 11:09 PM Syllabus for CIS 509: Analytics Unstructured Data (2025 Spring DYN)\\nhttps://canvas.asu.edu/courses/211724/assignments/syllabus 7/11'), Document(metadata={'source': './Syllabus.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='exercises, quizzes, and exams. Students are encouraged to speak to other students about the issues,\\nbut do not share work or answers. Failure to follow this policy may result in zero points for both the\\nreceiver and provider (if involved). Also, the instructor may take any other action described in the current\\nacademic integrity policy. By placing their names on assignments, students are affirming that the\\ncontents are their original work. Consulting work done by students in this course in other platforms or in\\nprevious years is a violation of academic integrity. This policy will be vigorously enforced. Sharing work\\nyou do in this course with others, whether in the course with you or not, can tempt others to violate this\\nacademic integrity policy and can result in that student’s failure in the course and dismissal from his/her\\nprogram.\\n \\nUse of Generative AI is Generally Permitted Within Guidelines\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI), including ChatGPT, are being used in workplaces all over the world to save\\ntime and improve outcomes by generating text, images, computer code, audio, or other media. Use of AI\\ntools is generally welcome in this class with attribution aligned with disciplinary guidelines. AI tools might\\nbe employed to brainstorm, draft, edit, revise, etc.  Any submitted course assignment not explicitly\\nidentified as having used generative AI will be assumed to be your original work. Using AI tools to\\ngenerate content without proper attribution will be considered a violation of the ASU Academic Integrity\\nPolicy, and students may be sanctioned for confirmed, non-allowable use. If at any point you have\\nquestions about what is permitted, contact the instructor to discuss before submitting work. \\n \\nAcademic Integrity and Ethical Behavior\\nA student who engages in academic misconduct as outlined in ASU’s academic integrity policy\\n(http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity) while attending a graduate program will receive strict\\npenalties. Those penalties ordinarily will range from a letter reduction in final course grade to expulsion\\nfrom the program and School of Business. The penalty will be decided by the course faculty member\\nand the Assistant Dean of Academic Affairs. All allegations of academic misconduct must be reported to\\nprogram administrators. Any subsequent act of academic misconduct, regardless of severity, will result in\\ndismissal from the program and the School of Business.\\n \\nInstructor Absence Policy\\nThis is from ACD 304-10:\\n“How Long Students Should Wait for an Absent Instructor: In the event the instructor fails to indicate a\\ntime obligation, the time obligation will be 15 minutes for class sessions lasting 90 minutes or less, and\\n1/9/25, 11:09 PM Syllabus for CIS 509: Analytics Unstructured Data (2025 Spring DYN)\\nhttps://canvas.asu.edu/courses/211724/assignments/syllabus 8/11'), Document(metadata={'source': './Syllabus.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='30 minutes for class sessions lasting more than 90 minutes. Students may be directed to wait longer by\\nsomeone from the academic unit if they know the instructor will arrive shortly.”\\n \\nReligious Accommodations\\nAccommodations will be made for students with religious holidays.  Below is a link to the calendar of\\nofficial religious holidays.  Each holiday noted with two asterisks denotes an observance for which work\\nis not allowed.

Behind the hype\\nassociated with these terms, some leading firms believe they are experiencing a fundamental shift in\\nhow they collect, analyze, and use data to differentiate themselves and build value for their customers.\\nThis change is being seen in large established firms like GE that are embracing big data and analytics\\nand much newer firms like Palantir that were built around the opportunity that big data and AI present.\\nIDC expects firm spending across various industries on analytics and AI to increase from $85.3 billion in\\n2021 to more than $204 billion in 2025.\\nThis course will combine hands-on experience with relevant readings to explore the strategies behind\\ndeep learning, AI, unstructured data analytics, and data science that drive decision-making and how\\nsuch strategies can lead to long-term competitive advantage. We will discuss the perspective that big\\ndata, deep learning, AI, and analytics are a revolutionary shift in some businesses as well as the counter\\nperspective that they are an evolution of many decades of effort in “traditional” analytics or business\\nintelligence. Upon completion of the course, you will be familiar with how analytics, big data, deep\\nlearning, and AI are changing the playing field for firms in order to build competitive advantage. You will\\nbe able to create a big data strategy for an organization and identify the tools and technologies, as well\\nas the skill sets required to achieve success. You will also be able to pose interesting and relevant\\nbusiness-based research questions and understand the general analytical approaches to answering\\nthem.\\n \\nW. P.

Lab Assignments (Individual) There will be six stand-alone lab assignments in this course. In our\\nclasses, we will have Python code examples to demonstrate how to leverage data analytics methods for\\nunstructured data analyses. The lab assignments will provide you opportunity to practice these methods\\non a dataset relevant to your course project.\\n \\n2. Course Project (Team) One of the major goals of this course is to offer hands-on data analytics\\nexperience. The term project is intended to provide such experience by having students process data\\nand perform analyses including text mining, network analysis, machine learning, or other statistical\\ninferences. This course will be using Python for the term project. An overview of the project will be\\nprovided in lecture slides. The project is meant to evolve weekly during the duration of this course. There\\nare three deliverables tied to project milestones: project proposal, exploratory data analyses, and final\\nproject presentation. \\n \\nStudent Responsibilities\\nAttendance \\nEveryone is required to attend classes in person. Zoom attendance is not an option. An online session\\nis not a substitute for an immersion session in most cases. Just like different business meetings, each\\nprogram modality, even hybrid ones, differ in regards to pedagogical approaches dramatically, so\\nunfortunately learning outcomes promised in a program are often not attained the same way across\\ndifferent media. \\n \\nExceptional cases for accommodations apply. ASU has predetermined exceptions that we list below for\\nyour awareness. We specify situations in which students CAN EXPECT vs those they MUST NOT\\nEXPECT accommodations. \\nCAN EXPECT ACCOMMODATIONS:   \\n1. ASU-sanctioned reasons: Jury / military duty, Religious holidays, Health impediments\\n2. Student Accessibility and Inclusive Learning needs (SAILS)\\n3. ONE ONLY event per term per student for any career-related absence (e.g. WPC supported affinity\\nconferences, career fair participation, or job-related travels). \\n \\nMUST NOT EXPECT ACCOMMODATIONS:\\n1/9/25, 11:09 PM Syllabus for CIS 509: Analytics Unstructured Data (2025 Spring DYN)\\nhttps://canvas.asu.edu/courses/211724/assignments/syllabus 6/111. Personal reasons of various kinds, no matter what nature \\n2. More than one career-related absence per term per student\\n \\nShould you have to miss a class in such cases only, professors can offer “suitable accommodations”,\\nwhich may or may not include Zoom attendance. The accommodations, if available, are to cover one\\nclass only, not more. Should you need exceptions for a longer period of time, please contact your\\nprogram operations staff, and / or your Associate Dean, Luiz.Mesquita@asu.edu\\n(mailto:Luiz.Mesquita@asu.edu) . \\n \\nAssignment Timeliness\\nAt the W. P. Carey School of Business Graduate Programs, “delivering assignments on time” is part of\\nthe assignment. Submitting an assignment late means the student failed the assignment at least in part,\\nand in some cases, entirely. Per ASU, students who turn in assignments on time are to have higher\\ngrades than those who turn in assignments late, and because grades are capped at the top, lateness will\\nnecessarily involve a grade penalty.\\n \\nWe allow late submissions of your assignments up to three days after the deadline. Each day in delay\\nhas a 10% grade penalty toward the total grade of the assignment. \\nCommunicating and Behaving Professionally\\nA hallmark of a W. P. Carey education is that everyone is courteous and professional when\\ncommunicating with each other. Soft skills listed in the code of professionalism represent that standard.\\nAll interactions with your peers, staff, and faculty are to follow that standard. It is ok to disagree with\\neach other on the basis of ideas, but it is not ok to be disagreeable. \\n \\nThe Graduate Programs Office takes the Professionalism Code very seriously because our mission is to\\nensure professionals who graduate from our programs continue to build up on our reputable brand,\\nwhich stands for “Business is Personal”. Please make yourself familiar with the Code, as those falling\\nshort of such standards are subject to disciplinary effects.\\n \\nW. P. Carey School of Business Honor Code\\nUnethical behavior by corporations has been linked with negative performance outcomes; the same is\\ntrue of unethical student behavior. It is expected that students will neither participate in nor condone\\nactivities such as cheating or plagiarism. You are expected to do your own work on all individual\\n1/9/25, 11:09 PM Syllabus for CIS 509: Analytics Unstructured Data (2025 Spring DYN)\\nhttps://canvas.asu.edu/courses/211724/assignments/syllabus 7/11exercises, quizzes, and exams. Students are encouraged to speak to other students about the issues,\\nbut do not share work or answers. Failure to follow this policy may result in zero points for both the\\nreceiver and provider (if involved). Also, the instructor may take any other action described in the current\\nacademic integrity policy. By placing their names on assignments, students are affirming that the\\ncontents are their original work. Consulting work done by students in this course in other platforms or in\\nprevious years is a violation of academic integrity. This policy will be vigorously enforced. Sharing work\\nyou do in this course with others, whether in the course with you or not, can tempt others to violate this\\nacademic integrity policy and can result in that student’s failure in the course and dismissal from his/her\\nprogram.\\n \\nUse of Generative AI is Generally Permitted Within Guidelines\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI), including ChatGPT, are being used in workplaces all over the world to save\\ntime and improve outcomes by generating text, images, computer code, audio, or other media. Use of AI\\ntools is generally welcome in this class with attribution aligned with disciplinary guidelines. AI tools might\\nbe employed to brainstorm, draft, edit, revise, etc.  Any submitted course assignment not explicitly\\nidentified as having used generative AI will be assumed to be your original work. Using AI tools to\\ngenerate content without proper attribution will be considered a violation of the ASU Academic Integrity\\nPolicy, and students may be sanctioned for confirmed, non-allowable use. If at any point you have\\nquestions about what is permitted, contact the instructor to discuss before submitting work. \\n \\nAcademic Integrity and Ethical Behavior\\nA student who engages in academic misconduct as outlined in ASU’s academic integrity policy\\n(http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity) while attending a graduate program will receive strict\\npenalties. Those penalties ordinarily will range from a letter reduction in final course grade to expulsion\\nfrom the program and School of Business. The penalty will be decided by the course faculty member\\nand the Assistant Dean of Academic Affairs. All allegations of academic misconduct must be reported to\\nprogram administrators. Any subsequent act of academic misconduct, regardless of severity, will result in\\ndismissal from the program and the School of Business.\\n \\nInstructor Absence Policy\\nThis is from ACD 304-10:\\n“How Long Students Should Wait for an Absent Instructor: In the event the instructor fails to indicate a\\ntime obligation, the time obligation will be 15 minutes for class sessions lasting 90 minutes or less, and\\n1/9/25, 11:09 PM Syllabus for CIS 509: Analytics Unstructured Data (2025 Spring DYN)\\nhttps://canvas.asu.edu/courses/211724/assignments/syllabus 8/1130 minutes for class sessions lasting more than 90 minutes. Students may be directed to wait longer by\\nsomeone from the academic unit if they know the instructor will arrive shortly.”\\n \\nReligious Accommodations\\nAccommodations will be made for students with religious holidays.  Below is a link to the calendar of\\nofficial religious holidays.  Each holiday noted with two asterisks denotes an observance for which work\\nis not allowed.  For these holidays, students will not be penalized in any way for missing class or\\nassignments.  This means that this will not count as an absence in class and they will be granted a\\nmakeup assignment or exam, etc. \\nhttps://eoss.asu.edu/cora/holidays (https://eoss.asu.edu/cora/holidays)\\nAll requests for accommodation must be submitted by the end of the second week of class. \\n \\nUniversity-Sanctioned Activities\\nAccommodations will be made for students who miss class related to university-sanctioned activities\\naccording to ACD 304-02.
